Simulation Metamodeling
Create a metamodel for a discrete-event simulation using modular DBNs.
This will show you how DBNs can be used to answer complex probabilistic and causal queries in simulation systems.

How dynamic bayesian networks are used in discrete-event simulation to answer complex probabilistic and causal queries in simulation systems.
