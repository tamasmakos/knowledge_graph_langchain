    "Mephistopheles and Faust are standing near a gathering of people, where flames are rising and witches are present. Mephistopheles comments on the lively atmosphere, but notes that in such a place, one cannot be alone. Faust expresses a desire to be at the top of the gathering, where he sees whirling smoke and thousands of people flocking to the evil spirit. Mephistopheles responds that the evil spirit will only create more problems, but suggests that they can find quiet in the midst of the chaos. He points out young and old witches, some of whom are veiled, and promises Faust that he can experience great joy with little effort.\n",
    "As they prepare to enter the gathering, Faust asks Mephistopheles how he intends to introduce himself, as a devil or conjurer. Mephistopheles prefers to remain incognito but may show his true nature on special occasions. He teases an old woman who is cautious around him, sensing that she has detected something hellish about him.\n",
    "Mephistopheles and Faust approach a group of people sitting around a fire, including a General, Minister, Parvenu, and Author, who are discussing the changing times and how the world is becoming more shallow. Mephistopheles comments that the people seem ripe for doom and that the world is on its last legs.\n",
    "A vendor of curious trinkets appears, showcasing items that have caused harm and mischief. Mephistopheles dismisses her wares as outdated and suggests that she should deal in newer, more exciting items. Faust is overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of the gathering, comparing it to a fair that surpasses Leipzig.\n",
    "Mephistopheles points out a woman named Lilith, Adam's first wife, warning Faust to beware of her beautiful but treacherous hair. Faust notices an old and young woman sitting on the grass, who seem to have been dancing. Mephistopheles encourages Faust to join in the revelry.\n",
    "As they dance, Faust shares a dream he had about an apple tree with two lovely apples, and the Young Witch responds by referencing the story of Adam and Eve. Mephistopheles shares a contrasting dream about a cloven tree with an ugly owl, and the Old Witch responds in kind. The Young Witch asks about Faust's presence, and he explains that Mephistopheles is everywhere, critiquing every step of the dance.\n",
    "Finally, a Proctophantasmist appears, lamenting the persistence of phantoms and delusions in the enlightened age.\n",

Faust warns her that her cries might wake the watchers of the night. Margaret questions who gave him the power to drag her from her cell at midnight and begs him to have pity and not be so harsh. She suggests that waiting until morning would be enough. Standing up, she laments her youth and the prospect of dying so soon, reflecting on her lost beauty which led to her downfall. She mentions that a friend was once near but is now distant, using the imagery of a torn wreath and scattered flowers to describe her state. Kneeling again, she implores him not to take her away forcibly, asks what she has done to harm him, and pleads for compassion, noting that this is the first time she has ever seen him."

Here oft I sat in moody thought alone, And vexed my soul with fasting and with prayer. Rich then in hope, in faith then strong, With tears and sobs my hands I wrung, And weened the end of that dire pest, From heaven’s highcounselled lord to wrest. Now their applause with mockery flouts mine ear. O could’st thou ope my heart and read it here, How little sire and son For such huge meed of thanks have done! My father was a grave old gentleman, Who o’er the holy secrets of creation, Sincere, but after his peculiar plan, Brooded, with whimsied speculation. Who, with adepts in painful gropings spent His days, within the smoky kitchen pent, And, after recipes unnumbered, made The unnatural mixtures of his trade. The tender lily and the lion red, A suitor bold, in tepid bath were wed, With open fiery flame well baked together, And squeezed from one bridechamber to another; Then, when the glass the queen discovered, Arrayed in youthful glistening pride, Here was the medicine, and the patient died, But no one questioned who recovered. Thus in these peaceful vales and hills, The plague was not the worst of ills, And Death his ghastly work pursued, The better for the hellish brewst we brewed. Myself to thousands the curst juice supplied; They pined away, and I must live to hear The praise of mercy in the murderer’s ear.\"\n",

The sun slants down, the day hath lived his date, But on he hies to tend another sphere. O that no wing upon my wish may wait To follow still and still in his career! Upborne on evening’s quenchless beams to greet The noiseless world illumined at my feet, Each peaceful vale, each crimsonflaming peak, Each silver rill whose tinkling waters seek The golden flood that feeds the fruitful plain. Then savage crags, and gorges dark, would rein My proud careering course in vain; Ev’n now the sea spreads out its shimmering bays, And charms the sense with ecstasy of gaze. Yet seems the god at length to sink; But, borne by this new impulse of my mind, I hasten on, his quenchless ray to drink, The day before me, and the night behind, The heavens above me, under me the sea. A lovely dream! meanwhile the god is gone. Alas! the soul, in wingèd fancy free, Seeks for a corporal wing, and findeth none. Yet in each breast ’tis deeply graven, Upward and onward still to pant, When over us, lost in the blue of heaven, Her quavering song the lark doth chaunt; When over piny peaks sublime The eagle soars with easy strain, And over lands and seas the crane Steers homeward to a sunnier clime.\"\n",

Then mounts the pure white moon before mine eye With mellow ray, and in her softening light, From rocky wall, from humid brake, upfloat The silvery shapes of times bygone, and soothe The painful pleasure of deepbrooding thought. Alas! that man enjoys no perfect bliss, I feel it now. Thou gav’st me with this joy, Which brings me near and nearer to the gods, A fellow, whom I cannot do without.
