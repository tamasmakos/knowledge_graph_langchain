# Knowledge Graph Experiments

This repository contains various experiments and tools for working with knowledge graphs, particularly focused on processing and analyzing literary texts.

## Key Components

### Faust Knowledge Graph Experiment

The `faust_knowledge_graph_experiment.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the process of converting text from Goethe's Faust into a knowledge graph. It uses the following key components:

- Neo4j Graph Database
- LangChain's LLMGraphTransformer
- Groq's LLM for natural language processing

Key code snippet:


```37:45:faust_knowledge_graph_experiment.ipynb
    "graph = Neo4jGraph(\n",
    "    url=NEO4J_URI,\n",
    "    username=NEO4J_USERNAME,\n",
    "    password=NEO4J_PASSWORD,\n",
    "    database=NEO4J_DATABASE\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "rate_limiter = InMemoryRateLimiter(\n",
    "    requests_per_second=1,\n",
```


### Bible Knowledge Graph Generation

The `knowledge_graph_first_experiment.ipynb` and `knowledge_graph_second_experiment.ipynb` notebooks show experiments with generating knowledge graphs from biblical texts. These notebooks utilize:

- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Hugging Face's transformers
- Sentence embeddings using SentenceTransformer
- Neo4j for graph storage and querying

### Dynamic Bayesian Network Game

The `dbn_game.ipynb` notebook contains an implementation of a detective game using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. This demonstrates the application of probabilistic graphical models in an interactive scenario.

## Setup and Dependencies

To run the experiments, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies include:


```1:15:requirements.txt
torch==2.1.2
packaging
ipykernel
tenacity!=8.4.0
langchain
neo4j-driver
streamlit
langchainhub
langchain-community
langchain_groq
datasets
einops
transformers==4.42.4
sentence-transformers==2.7.0
langchain-experimental
```


## Configuration

The project uses Streamlit for some components and requires configuration of secrets. Make sure to set up your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with the necessary API keys and database credentials.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter notebooks, use a Jupyter environment that supports the installed dependencies. For Streamlit components, you can run them using:

```
streamlit run [filename].py
```

## Note

This project is experimental and may require adjustments based on your specific environment and use case. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and rights when working with copyrighted texts or external APIs.
